I have created a browser extension for Trovu. With it, you can define a keyboard shortcut, for instance _Ctrl-1_ which opens a light version of the Trovu homepage, and with your language & country (or Github) settings.

It is available for [Chrome](https://trovu.net/docs/users/integration/#chrome) and [Firefox](https://trovu.net/docs/users/integration/#firefox).

For Safari users on Mac OS, please consider the [Raycast extension](/docs/users/integration/#raycast).
