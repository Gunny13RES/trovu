Trovu is and always will be [free](https://github.com/trovu/trovu/blob/master/LICENSE). To support the work, there are a [few options that I just added to the docs](https://trovu.net/docs/#sponsor).

At the moment, you can:

-   Become a [sponsor on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/trovu). There are various tiers, each with benefits, starting from $2 per month. Your sponsorship will be visible on GitHub, which is also a nice form of support.

If your preferred option is missing, please [reach out](https://trovu.net/docs/users/support/).

Sponsorship is also a great way to gauge interest: How many of you like it enough to not only use it but also support it financially? That would be valuable feedback!

Indeed, the more sponsors there are, the easier it becomes to work on Trovu full-time.
