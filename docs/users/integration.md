# Use Trovu on your device

## General

You can integrate Trovu into your web browsing experience using one of two methods:

### Set Trovu as Your Default Search Engine

-   By replacing your current default search engine with Trovu, all your searches will be directed to Trovu.
-   You can enhance this setup with a [Default Keyword](advanced.md#default-keyword), allowing any unrecognized Trovu shortcut to revert to your usual default search engine.

### Add Trovu as an Additional Search Engine

-   This method allows you to keep your current default search engine while adding Trovu alongside it.
-   To use Trovu shortcuts, simply prefix your query with a designated keyword (e.g., `t`).

I recommend the second option for beginners. Many users who chose the first option found that their intended searches were disrupted when the first word of their query triggered a Trovu shortcut.

With Option 2, you maintain greater control and predictability over your searches, allowing you to experiment with Trovu shortcuts only when you choose to.

## Desktop web browser

### Firefox

#### Browser extension

The easiest way to use Trovu in Firefox is the [browser add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/trovu/). It allows you to set keyboard shortcuts which open a Trovu input with suggestions in a new tab or window.

#### (Default) search engine

Another option is adding Trovu as a search engine, optionally making it default.

However, no shortcut suggestions are available here.

1.  Open [trovu.net](https://trovu.net/), either [with your GitHub username](advanced.md) or without:
    -   `https://trovu.net/?#github=YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`, or
    -   `https://trovu.net/?#country=gb&language=en`. (adjust to your country & language)
1.  In the **browser address bar**, right-click.
1.  Select **Add "Trovu"**. It is the last item.
1.  Open a [new tab](about:blank) with the URL:

        about:preferences#search

1.  Optional: Under **Default Search Engine**, select _Trovu_.

    -   Make Trovu your default search engine:
        1.  When found, click the 3 dots right to it.
        1.  Select **Make default**.
    -   Set a keyword for Trovu, and use it only with this keyword
        -   Click the üñäÔ∏è pen.
        -   Edit _shortcut_, e.g. to `t`.

### Other

Use one of these URL templates and add it where your browser allows to set custom browser search engines:

    https://trovu.net/process/?#country=gb&language=en&query=%s
    https://trovu.net/process/?#github=YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME&query=%s

(Note the `process/` part in the URL! You may need to adjust your `country`, `language` or `github` parameter.)
