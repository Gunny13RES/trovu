_by [Georg Jähnig](https://github.com/georgjaehnig/) & the [Trovu team](https://github.com/orgs/trovu/teams/editors)_

Search 1000+ websites in a command-line way, with

-   [curated](https://trovu.net/docs/editors/) and [personal shortcuts](https://trovu.net/docs/users/advanced/),
-   organized by [namespaces](https://trovu.net/docs/shortcuts/namespaces/),
-   allowing [multiple and typed arguments](https://trovu.net/docs/shortcuts/url/),
-   with [maximum privacy](https://trovu.net/docs/privacy/).
